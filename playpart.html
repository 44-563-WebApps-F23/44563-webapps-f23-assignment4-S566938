    <h1>Vinod Ramavath acts in play</h1>
    <h5>Hedda Gabler by Henrik Ibsen</h5>
    <p>
        <p>HEDDA.
        Can I not help you in any way? </p> 
        <p>MISS TESMAN.
        Oh, you must not think of it! Hedda Tesman must have no hand in such
        mournful work. Nor let her thought dwell on it either--not at this time.</p>  
    <p>HEDDA.
        
        One is not always mistress of one's thoughts--</p> 
    <p> MISS TESMAN.
        
        [Continuing.] Ah yes, it is the way of the world. At home we shall be
        sewing a shroud; and here there will soon be sewing too, I suppose--but
        of another sort, thank God!
          GEORGE TESMAN enters by the hall door.</p>
        <p>HEDDA.
        Ah, you have come at last!</p>
    <p>TESMAN.
        You here, Aunt Julia? With Hedda? Fancy that!</p>
    <p> MISS TESMAN.
        I was just going, my dear boy. Well, have you done all you promised?</p>
